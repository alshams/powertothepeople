# Power to the People: Imagining a Society Without Policing and Capitalism

> We have two evils to fight, capitalism and racism. We must destroy both racism and capitalism

\- Huey P. Newton

As the US is once again publicly debating the role of the police and policing after the murder of George Floyd and the resulting protests, the recognition that the police are not here for the people, but to suppress the people, is no longer a radical notion. Police reform, even to the point of defunding police departments, has become a viable position for some politicians to support during the 2020 election year. But these conversations do nothing without tackling the issue of policing and its links to capitalism and racism.

## The Roots of Policing and Capitalism are in Slavery

From the founding of the US colonies, the economic viability of US capitalism was based in slavery with slave patrols, an early form of policing, as an enforcement mechanism. Policing was based around the viability of the economic system and control.

This link between Black liberation and socialist alternatives to capitalism was a key part of the US civil rights movement, despite attempts to deradicalize history. Organizations, such as the Black Panthers, were explicit about the connection between racism and capitalism and built coalitions across racial lines (see the [Rainbow Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Coalition_%28Fred_Hampton%29), which was founded by the Black Panthers, the Appalachian Young Patriots, and the Puerto Rican Young Lords). Some scholars, like Asad Haider, have even described it as "the closest US equivalent to mass workers' movement in postwar Europe" ([Mistaken Identity](https://www.versobooks.com/books/2716-mistaken-identity), pg 15). 

In more recent years, policing has expanded to become a central part of the US social fabric. Black, brown and indigenous folx are disproportionately imprisoned in public and private US prisons bolstered by legal and education systems that prioritize policing and imprisonment along racial lines. Once in prison, economic hardships are further perpetuated (including a high rate of recidivism due to lack of economic opportunities) and prisoners work for major US companies for almost no pay. Politicians, such as Kamala Harris, even use policing to enforce truancy laws and build policing and prisons into the fabric of all public institutions.

Policing and prisons have been essential to US racial policies, enforcement, and punishment. Some additional examples are:
* the Japanese internment camps during World War 2
* the CIA black sites where Muslim men were tortured during the US War on Terror
* US military actions to enforce resource extraction from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East

Antiracist and police abolition movements in the US inherently question US capitalism and economic structure.

## Defunding the Police is not Enough

> Abolition is not only, or perhaps not even 
primarily, about the negative process of tearing down, but it's also about building up, it's about creating new institutions

\-[Angela Davis](https://youtu.be/DrP-C4scIXs)

It is not enough to simply call for tearing down policing, the police, and prisons. These concepts have become integral to the US society and an unspoken assumption--the US population, by and large, does not question whether policing should exist.

Calls to "Defund the Police" are already being co-opted by politicians to push a friendly face of policing because people cannot imagine what a society without policing looks like. As antiracist activists working to abolish prisons, we need to provide alternatives and new systems that can exist without policing.

At a basic level, this requires putting power in the hands of the people. Ensuring needs, such as shelter, food, education, and healthcare, are provided should be prioritized. Alternative models to justice, such as transformative justice, even offer examples of non-punitive justice systems.
