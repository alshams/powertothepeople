# In Solidarity with Carlos Adrian Ingram-Lopez

On April 21, 2020  Carlos Adrian Ingram-Lopez was murdered by Tucson police. In the released video (not linked due to graphic content), Ingram-Lopez was handcuffed and held to the ground for 12 minutes while police ignored cries that Ingram-Lopez could not breathe. 

## Expansion of Policing Around Immigration

In the past 20 years, some of the biggest expansions of policing have been justified through immigration. At the start of the US "War on Terror", George W. Bush created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Through DHS and the "War on Terror", the US has consistently justified targeting and killing Latinxs, Arab (primarily Iraqi and Syrian), Central Asian (Iranian and Afghani), and South Asian (primarily Pakistani) communities in the US and abroad.

Throughout the 2000s, ICE and police coordinated efforts to target Latinxs communities in the US leading to a massive expansion of private prisons and policing based on immigration. In 2010, Arizona became the first state in the US to codify policing of immigration with SB 1070. The bill required people to carry proof of citizenship or documented residency and required police to check immigration status if there was "reasonable suspicion." Despite the fact that Arizona has had prominent examples of undocumented immigrants from Europe, SB 1070 was created to justify policing brown bodies and further expansion of the private prisons--many of which are migrant detention centers.

As the US once again discusses police brutality and policing, the murder of Ingram-Lopez is a reminder that abolishing policing also requires abolishing the  the economic incentives (e.g., private prisons), military connections (e.g., policing brown bodies across the globe), and border policing.
