# Build Community 

I believe the following statements are both true:  

* Voting against Trump is an act of harm reduction  
* Voting for Biden is the wrong decision  

## Voting against Trump is an act of harm reduction

Since the election of Trump, attacks on marginalized communities and anyone not wealthy have become more visible and increased in cruelty. Even though Trump did not invent all of the attacks, the rhetoric used and blatant visibility shows these actions are done simply to harm certain communities and/or support Trump and the wealthy minority that already has power at the expense of everyone else.

Getting Trump removed from office won't heal any of the past harms or stop the harms that are supported by the wealthy minority that holds power. But, it will stop the blatant dehumanization and now accepted cruelty in the harm being done. Removing Trump can help the people within the borders of the US, in particular the marginalized communities, reduce panic and hopefully no longer feel under constant threat.


## Voting for Biden is the wrong decision

The Democratic party and Biden have made clear that they are relying on and anti-Trump vote in 2020. Even though Biden has shifted policies to appeal to a wider range of voters, there is no indication that Biden will take actions to improve the lives of the majority of the people living in the US, in particular marginalized communities.

Voting for Biden would would incentivize the Democratic establishment to continue disenfranchising voters and leaving marginalized communities behind. Under Democrat majority administrations, including policies Biden supported, the US has furthered the wealth accumulation and disenfranchisement of the majority of people within the US borders. 

As long as the Democratic party can rely on votes without needing to improve the well being of all people within the borders of the US, they will not change their positions to focus away from the wealthy minority who already have power.

## Power to the People

This is not an excuse to be silent or to disenfranchise yourself. It is a call to recognize the power of the people and shift the power away from a representative democracy that continues to act in bad faith and harm people, regardless of whether there is a Republican or Democrat administration.

A government for the people, ensures that everyone within its borders, regardless of immigration status, is provided for. At a minimum, this means everyone:

* Can live in freedom without the fear of being murdered or imprisoned based on who they are
* Has decent housing without fear of being evicted and regardless of employment status
* Has access to decent healthcare that is accessible regardless of money, insurance, or employment status
* Can access decent education that does not dehumanize or degrade anyone regardless of where they live or how much money they have
* Can feed themselves and their family, regardless of money or employment status
* Is able to travel free within and across any borders without fear of being imprisoned or deported

In the absence of a government or the ability to have a government that works for us, we need to directly support each other, build community, and build new institutions or structures that are for the people.
